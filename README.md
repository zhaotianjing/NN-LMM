# NN-LMM
Data, scripts and results for NN-LMM paper.

* Part1_NNLMM_vs_singlestep: compare the prediction performance of NN-LMM to the single-step approach in [Christensenet al.(2021)](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyab130). (Figure 4 in NN-LMM paper)
* Part2_NNLMM_nonlinear: the prediction performance of NN-GBLUP with a linear function was compared to NN-GBLUP with a nonlinear sigmoid activation function, when the underlying relationship between intermediate omics features and phenotypes was nonlinear for the simulated datasets.  (Figure 5 in NN-LMM paper)
* Part3_NNGBLUP_vs_NNBayesC: performance of NN-LMM with a GBLUP prior (i.e, NN-GBLUP) and NN-LMM with a BayesC prior (i.e., NN-BayesC) were compared, and linear activation functions were applied. (Figure 6 in NN-LMM paper)
